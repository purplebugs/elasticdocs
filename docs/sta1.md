:::tip

The Elastic Stack refers to the entire product suite that [Elastic](https://elastic.co) makes

:::

* Elasticsearch is at the heart of the product suite and is only one of the products, allowing you to search, analyze and store data

* Kibana is another product which, using the data stored in Elasticsearch, is the window into the Elastic Stack

There are more products, however for now this site will only go into these two
