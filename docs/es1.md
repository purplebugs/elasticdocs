## Why learn Elasticsearch

Because Elasticsearch is an awesome, powerful search and analytics engine... and is highly valued in the I.T. marketplace.

Elasticsearch can also be hard, and getting started can be tricky.  I wanted to keep things ultra simple for hobbyists, and who knows, if you want to go further, please do.

Most of all it is fun!


:::tip

This is a hobby project and is in no way officially affiliated with [Elastic](https://elastic.co)

I highly recommend taking Elastic's official [courses](https://www.elastic.co/training/certification) for learning the Elastic Stack or if wanting to become Elastic Certified

## How

This hobby site will introduce you to different data sets and show how to use Elasticsearch to make them searchable, helping you organise and analyse your data in meaningful ways.

It will also show you how to create visualisations to present your data in fun, clever and intuitive ways.


## But I don't know anything about programming!!

Doesn't matter.  If some terms are not familiar, don't worry for now and enjoy reading along.


## But I don't know anything about data or databases!!

Doesn't matter.  An example of a data set could be a list of your favourite books.  No big deal.


## But I don't know anything about Elasticsearch!!

Neither did I when I started.  So what.
