## Why

Because Elasticsearch is an awesome, powerful search and analytics engine... and is highly valued in the I.T. marketplace.

Elasticsearch can also be hard, and getting started can be tricky. I wanted to keep things ultra simple for hobbyists, and who knows, if you want to go further, please do.

Most of all it is fun!

## How

This hobby site will introduce you to different data sets and show how to use Elasticsearch to make data searchable helping you organise and analyse your data in meaningful ways.

It will also show you how to create visualisations to present your data in fun, clever and intuitive ways.

Though, for now there are no examples as it is a "skeleton site". "Coming soon" as they say...

## When

Now.

ðŸ™€ But I don't know anything about programming!!

ðŸŒŸ Doesn't matter. If some terms are not familiar, don't worry for now and enjoy reading along.

ðŸ˜± But I don't know anything about data or databases!!

ðŸŒŸ Doesn't matter. An example of a data set could be a list of your favourite books. No big deal.

ðŸ¤¯ But I don't know anything about Elasticsearch!!

ðŸŒŸ Neither did I when I started. So what. You are a star.
