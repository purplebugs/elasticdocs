### Purpose

This site is made with love from the ground up for anyone who wants to understand simple use cases for the Elastic Stack

:::note

This is a hobby project and is in no way officially affiliated with [Elastic](https://elastic.co)

I highly recommend taking Elastic's official [courses](https://www.elastic.co/training/certification) for learning the Elastic Stack or if wanting to become Elastic Certified

### Why "Elasticsearch for Fun"?

Because learning it was mostly done as a hobby, and it is fun.

The original title was "Elasticsearch for Oldies" because
[Richard Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Simmons) has always been a fun and joyfull force, spreading good health and cheer. Something about the title of his classic workouts "Sweatin' to the Oldies" always made me smile, and I wanted to re-use the word for one of my hobbies.

Besides that, seniors have so much wisdom, experience, patience and curiousity. This makes seniors great candidates for learning something new, abstract, and even complex, so why not let seniors feel directly included in learning something new in tech.

Though, since this site is for anyone at any age I since updated the name to be "Elasticsearch for Fun".
