Welcome to this site, created with [**Docusaurus 2 alpha**](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

This site is made from love from the ground up for anyone who wants to understand simple use cases for the Elastic Stack.

This is a hobby project and is in no way officially affiliated with [Elastic](elastic.co)

I highly recommend taking Elastic's official [courses](https://www.elastic.co/training/certification) for learning the Elastic Stack or if wanting to become Elastic Certified.
