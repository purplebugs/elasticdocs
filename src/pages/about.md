# About this site

## Purpose

This site is made with love from the ground up for anyone who wants to understand simple use cases for the Elastic Stack ðŸ’œ

Elasticsearch can be hard, and I found getting started to be tricky ðŸ¤“

I challenged myself to create the site I wish I had when I was getting started, and this is it... always changing and evolving, just like life, like myself, and like Elasticsearch ðŸ˜‡

:::note

This is a hobby project and is in no way officially affiliated with [Elastic](https://elastic.co)

I highly recommend taking Elastic's official [courses](https://www.elastic.co/training/certification) for learning the Elastic Stack or if wanting to become Elastic Certified
